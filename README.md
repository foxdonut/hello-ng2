# hello-ng2

Trying an example with Angular 2, using node and browserify.

* See the setup in `package.json`
* Run `npm i` (`i` is short for `install`)
* `npm run build`
* `npm start`
* To reload changes, open another shell and run `npm run watch`

Credit to https://github.com/armorik83/commonjs-friendly-angular2 for the script that builds angular2 to make it commonjs- (and thus browserify-) friendly.
